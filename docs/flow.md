Okay, here are the user flows for the different roles you mentioned for the water purification system:

**1. Customer User Flow:**

1.  **Access the Platform:** The customer navigates to the company website ([https://www.davisandshirtliff.com/]([invalid%20URL%20removed])) and finds the section for water purification system recommendations or quoting. This might be a dedicated page or a button leading to the system.
2.  **Fill the Inquiry Form:** The customer fills out a detailed form with their water requirements and information, including:
      * Contact information (Name, Email, Phone, etc.)
      * Location details (Address, Region, etc.)
      * Water source (e.g., Well, Municipal Supply, River, Lake)
      * Daily water requirement (in liters or gallons)
      * Intended use of the purified water (e.g., Drinking, Irrigation, Industrial Process)
      * Option to upload existing lab test data (e.g., PDF, CSV) or manually input parameters (pH, TDS, Iron, etc.).
      * Indication of urgency for the solution.
      * Budget range for the system.
3.  **Submit the Form:** Once all the required information is entered, the customer submits the form.
4.  **Receive Provisional Recommendation & Quote:**
      * The system processes the submitted data.
      * The customer receives an automated, provisional recommendation for a suitable water purification system.
      * Along with the recommendation, a preliminary quote for the system is generated and presented to the customer (this might be displayed on the screen or sent via email).
5.  **Review and Decide:** The customer reviews the recommendation and the provisional quote. They may:
      * Accept the recommendation and proceed to the next steps (e.g., contacting sales for a detailed discussion).
      * Request adjustments or further information.
      * Decide not to proceed.

**2. Engineer User Flow:**

1.  **Access the Internal Dashboard:** The engineer logs into the internal platform or dashboard designed for engineers and sales teams.
2.  **Review New Submissions:** The engineer checks for new water purification system inquiries submitted by customers.
3.  **Verify Lab Data (if provided):** If the customer uploaded lab test results, the engineer reviews and verifies the accuracy and completeness of this data.
4.  **Evaluate System Recommendation:** The engineer reviews the system recommendation generated by the AI based on the customer's input.
5.  **Adjust System Design (if necessary):** Based on their expertise and the specifics of the customer's needs, the engineer can make adjustments to the recommended system components, configuration, or capacity.
6.  **Finalize Quote:** The engineer reviews the provisional quote, makes any necessary adjustments based on the finalized system design (e.g., updated component pricing, installation costs), and finalizes the official quote.
7.  **Approve or Request Further Information:** The engineer can either approve the finalized quote, making it ready for the sales team, or they might request additional information from the customer (e.g., clarification on requirements, new lab tests if initial data is insufficient).

**3. Sales Representative User Flow:**

1.  **Access the Internal Dashboard:** The sales representative logs into the same internal platform or dashboard.
2.  **View Finalized Quotes:** The sales representative can see a list of finalized quotes prepared by the engineering team.
3.  **Review Customer Details:** For each quote, the sales representative can view the customer's contact information, their initial requirements, the recommended system, and the final quote amount.
4.  **Check Urgency and Budget:** The sales representative reviews the customer's indicated urgency and their budget to prioritize follow-ups.
5.  **Prepare for Sales Call:** Using all the available information, the sales representative prepares for a call or meeting with the customer.
6.  **Initiate Sale and Installation:** The sales representative contacts the customer to discuss the recommendation, answer questions, and guide them through the sales process. This includes finalizing the order, discussing payment terms, and scheduling installation and delivery logistics.
7.  **Track Sales Pipeline:** The sales representative updates the status of the lead in the system, tracking progress through the sales pipeline until the system is installed and the sale is complete.

**Other Potential Users (and their flows would be defined based on their specific roles and access needs):**

  * **Admin Backend User:** This user (likely an administrator within Davis & Shirtliff) would have access to an admin backend to:
      * Manage the list of available water purification devices and their pricing.
      * Update the rules or logic used by the AI recommendation engine.
      * Manage user accounts for engineers and sales representatives.
      * Generate reports on system usage, inquiries, and sales.
      * Configure bonus features like PDF generation and email notifications.
  * **Customer Support User:** This user might have access to a view of the customer inquiries and recommendations to provide support and answer general questions. Their flow would involve:
      * Accessing the dashboard.
      * Searching for customer inquiries.
      * Viewing the submitted information and the system recommendation.
      * Responding to customer queries via phone or email.
