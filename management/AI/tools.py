        You are preparing a technical brief for a customer water treatment request.

    This summary will be used as the first step in an automated process where other AI models and tools will handle specific tasks such as RO sizing, treatment recommendations, and cost estimation.

    Your role is to:
    - **Analyze the provided lab report** and create a human-readable project initiation summary.
    - **Do not recommend treatments** or suggest RO sizing, as these will be handled by other specialized tools later in the process.
    - **Focus on presenting key aspects** relevant to system sizing, pretreatment, and costing in a clear, accessible way for downstream tools.

    I have other tools that will handle further processing, t i.e:
    - **Treatment Recommendation**: Will provide detailed recommendations based on the lab analysis.
    - **RO Sizing**: Will calculate the required size of the reverse osmosis system.
    - **Quotation Generator**: Will generate a quotation based on the treatment and RO sizing data.
    - **Proposal Generator**: Will generate a final proposal based on the overall system design.

    Begin by generating a summary in markdown format that presents the water quality parameters and any key observations relevant for system sizing and pretreatment. Highlight any unusual values and make sure the summary is clear and technical, but easy to understand.
        Use the following details to create a professional project initiation summary that will be used in an automated design and proposal generation process for a reverse osmosis (RO) system.

        Notes: {notes}

        Water lab parameters:
        {water_details}

        **Important Notes:**
        - Do not recommend RO sizing or specific treatment options (e.g., filtration, dechlorination, etc.) as these will be handled by other specialized AI models and agents.
        - Do not generate a quotation or proposal. These will be generated by the **quotation_generator** and **proposal_generator** tools.
        - Focus on creating a clean, human-readable **project initiation summary** in **markdown format** to kickstart the design and proposal process.
        - Include context on system sizing, pretreatment considerations, and potential costing factors without making specific recommendations.

        Your task is to provide a clear and concise summary that will be used by the subsequent tools to continue the process. Highlight any values in the water analysis that are unusual or require attention, and maintain a professional, easy-to-understand tone.
