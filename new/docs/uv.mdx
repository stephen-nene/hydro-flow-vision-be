To update your `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files using the latest list of requirements (like the one you just shared), you can use [**`uv`**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (by Astral) to regenerate and lock dependencies properly. Here's a clear step-by-step guide:

---

### ✅ STEP 1: Clean your current project dependencies (optional but recommended)

If you're rebuilding or re-aligning:

```bash
rm uv.lock
rm -rf .venv  # Or your virtual environment folder
```

---

### ✅ STEP 2: Create or update your `pyproject.toml`

You can manually edit the `[project]` section or use `uv pip compile` to scaffold from a `requirements.txt`.

#### Option A: Start from `requirements.txt`

1. Save the full list into a `requirements.txt`.
2. Run:

```bash
uv pip compile requirements.txt --upgrade --output pyproject.toml
```

This will generate a `pyproject.toml` file with all dependencies in the `[project]` section and constraints properly tracked.

#### Option B: Add dependencies manually

Edit `pyproject.toml` like this:

```toml
[project]
name = "your-project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
  "annotated-types==0.7.0",
  "anyio==4.9.0",
  "asgiref==3.8.1",
  ...
]
```

(You can copy the list from our previous response and paste it inside `dependencies = [ ... ]`.)

---

### ✅ STEP 3: Use `uv` to install & lock dependencies

Once your `pyproject.toml` is set:

```bash
uv venv  # Optional: create a virtual environment
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml  # This installs and creates uv.lock
```

Or, simply:

```bash
uv pip install  # if you're already in a directory with pyproject.toml
```

`uv` will:

* Resolve all versions,
* Download and install the wheels,
* Create a new `uv.lock` file.

---

### ✅ STEP 4: Check your environment

To verify:

```bash
uv pip list  # View installed packages
```

Or use:

```bash
uv pip check  # Check for version conflicts or issues
```

---

### ✅ Notes

* To **add a new package**, run:

```bash
uv pip install somepackage
```

This updates both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

* To **upgrade all**:

```bash
uv pip compile --upgrade
```

Would you like me to generate a valid `pyproject.toml` from the merged list for you?
