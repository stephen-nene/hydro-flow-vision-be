## 💡 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**Goal:** Build a smart platform that lets customers input their water data (like lab results, source, usage), and the system recommends a suitable purification solution + generates a provisional quote.  
**Users:**  
- **Customer:** Fills form with water details and requirements  
- **Engineer:** Reviews submissions, verifies lab results, finalizes the system design  
- **Sales Team:** Views quote, budget, and logistics to initiate sale & installation

## 🧭 SYSTEM FLOW

### 1. **Frontend Form (Customer Facing)**
Customer fills a detailed form with:
- Contact info, location
- Water source
- Daily water requirement
- Intended use of water
- Upload or manually input **lab test data** (pH, TDS, Iron, etc.)
- Select urgency and budget

➡️ **Upon submission**:  
Send all data to backend for processing

---

### 2. **Backend Processing**
- **Step 1: Data validation**
  - Ensure all required fields are filled
  - If lab results are uploaded, parse the file (CSV, Excel, PDF to text)

- **Step 2: AI-powered Recommendation Engine**
  - Based on water quality and usage data, recommend treatment systems (e.g., Reverse Osmosis + UV)
  - Match lab results to predefined rules, OR use ML classification model trained on past device-lab matches

- **Step 3: Quote Generation**
  - Pull pricing & components from internal database/ERP
  - Estimate installation & transport based on region
  - Generate provisional quote with breakdown

---

### 3. **Engineer & Sales Dashboard (Internal Use)**
Engineers log in to:
- Review and adjust recommendations
- Finalize quotes
- Approve or request new lab tests

Sales Team can:
- View finalized quotes
- Check urgency and customer budget
- Prepare sales call and delivery pipeline

### 🧠 AI MODEL IDEAS (to plug into the system later)
You can choose based on available data:
#### Option 1: **Rule-Based Recommendation**
If you don’t have enough data, use hard-coded logic based on water parameter ranges.
> If TDS > 500 ppm and pH < 6.5 ➝ Recommend RO + UV

#### Option 2: **Classification Model (if data is available)**
Train a model using `scikit-learn` or `XGBoost`:
- Inputs: Lab values + usage type
- Output: Recommended purification system

## 📁 BONUS FEATURES TO INCLUDE

- Admin backend: manage devices, pricing, rules
- PDF generation for final quotes
- Email notifications (customer gets quote via email)
- Chatbot (for later): Ask users lab-related questions if values are missing
