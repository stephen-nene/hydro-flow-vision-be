To design an AI-powered water filtration system for a hackathon, focus on integrating real-time sensor data with AI optimization for efficiency, cost savings, and reliability. Below is a structured approach:

### **Core Idea**
**AI-Driven Adaptive Water Treatment System**  
Combine IoT sensors and AI to optimize filtration processes, predict maintenance, and adapt to changing water conditions in real time.

---

### **Key Components**
1. **Hardware/Sensors**  
   - Monitor parameters: Turbidity, pH, TDS, chlorine, flow rate, temperature, heavy metals (e.g., arsenic), bacterial presence.
   - Use IoT-enabled devices for data transmission (e.g., LoRaWAN, cellular).

2. **AI/ML Models**  
   - **Real-Time Optimization**: Adjust treatment steps (e.g., chemical dosing, backwash cycles) based on sensor inputs.
   - **Predictive Maintenance**: Forecast filter clogging or pump failures using historical data.
   - **Contamination Prediction**: Train models on weather/seasonal data to anticipate spikes in pollutants (e.g., post-rainfall runoff).
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Flag sudden changes (e.g., chemical spills) and trigger emergency protocols.

3. **Energy Efficiency**  
   - Optimize energy use for pumps/RO systems by aligning operations with demand and water quality (e.g., reduce pressure during low TDS).

4. **Adaptive Treatment Workflow**  
   - Use AI to bypass unnecessary steps (e.g., skip UV treatment if bacterial levels are low) to save resources.

### **Hackathon Implementation Plan**
**MVP Focus**: Predictive maintenance + real-time turbidity/pH adjustment.  

1. **Sensor Simulation**  
   - Use mock data (Python scripts) for turbidity, pH, and flow rate if hardware is limited.

2. **AI Model**  
   - Build a lightweight model (e.g., Random Forest or LSTM) to:  
     - Predict filter clogging based on pressure drop trends.  
     - Recommend chemical dosing (e.g., chlorine) based on pH/turbidity.  

3. **Dashboard**  
   - Create a simple UI (e.g., Flask/Django or Streamlit) showing:  
     - Real-time sensor data.  
     - AI recommendations (e.g., "Increase backwash frequency").  
     - Maintenance alerts.  

4. **Demo Scenario**  
   - Simulate a heavy rainfall event: Show how the AI preemptively adjusts chemical dosing and filter cycles to handle increased sediment.

### **Value Proposition**
- **Cost Reduction**: Extend filter lifespan by 20–30% via predictive maintenance.  
- **Energy Savings**: Optimize pump operations to cut energy use by 15–25%.  
- **Reliability**: Ensure consistent water quality during contamination events.  
- **Scalability**: Deployable in remote areas with edge computing (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

---

### **Tools & Resources**
- **Data**: Use open datasets (e.g., USGS Water Data) or synthetic data.  
- **ML Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch.  
- **IoT Platforms**: AWS IoT, Arduino, or Node-RED for data pipelines.  
- **Visualization**: Grafana, Power BI, or custom dashboards.

### **Pitch Highlights**
- **Problem**: Inefficient manual systems waste resources and fail during crises.  
- **Solution**: AI automates decisions, reduces costs, and ensures safe water.  
- **Differentiator**: Combines real-time adaptation with predictive insights.  
- **Ask**: Partner with Davis & Shirtliff to pilot sensors and refine models.  

This approach balances innovation with hackathon feasibility, addressing key pain points in water treatment while leveraging AI’s strengths.
