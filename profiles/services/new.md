Alright! If you want to use an AI model instead of a database for question generation, you can integrate it into your `ChatConsumer`. Since you already have an `ai_service.py` file, I assume you have an AI service setup. You can modify your code like this:

---

### **Step 1: Modify `create_new_chat` to use AI for question generation**
Replace the part where you're fetching a question from the database with an AI-generated question.

#### **Modify `create_new_chat` in `ChatConsumer`:**
```python
from valentino.services.ai_service import generate_ai_question  # Import your AI service function

@database_sync_to_async
def create_new_chat(self):
    print("Entered create_new_chat function")
    try:
        print(f"Creating new chat for speed_date_id={self.speed_date_id}, participant_id={self.participant_id}...")

        # Generate a new AI-based question
        new_question_text = generate_ai_question()

        if not new_question_text:
            print("AI failed to generate a question.")
            return None

        new_chat = SpeedChat.objects.create(
            speed_date_id=self.speed_date_id,
            participant_id=self.participant_id,
            question_text=new_question_text  # Use question_text instead of a ForeignKey
        )

        print(f"New chat created successfully with AI-generated question: {new_question_text}")
        return new_chat

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in create_new_chat: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
        return None
```
---

### **Step 2: Implement AI Question Generation in `ai_service.py`**
Now, in your `ai_service.py`, define the `generate_ai_question()` function.  
You can use an OpenAI API, DeepSeek API, or a local LLM to generate questions dynamically.

#### **Example: Using OpenAI (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5)**
```python
import openai

def generate_ai_question():
    prompt = "Generate an interesting icebreaker question for a speed dating event."

    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-4",  # Use "gpt-3.5-turbo" if you prefer
            messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=0.7
        )

        question = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
        return question

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error generating AI question: {e}")
        return "What's your favorite way to spend a weekend?"
```
üîπ *This function sends a request to OpenAI to generate a new question dynamically.*

### **Alternative AI Use Cases for Your Project**
AI can enhance your speed dating app beyond just question generation. Here are some ideas:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Matchmaking**
- Use AI to analyze participant responses and match users based on shared interests.
- Example: Run user responses through an NLP model and calculate compatibility scores.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Analysis on Chat Responses**
- Analyze participant responses to see if they‚Äôre enjoying the conversation.
- Example: If someone consistently gives positive responses, pair them with similar users.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Chatbot for Icebreakers**
- If a conversation dies out, an AI chatbot can suggest fun topics to keep things engaging.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Voice-to-Text Conversion (Speech AI)**
- Let users send voice messages, transcribe them with AI, and analyze the sentiment.

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Based User Feedback Analysis**
- Use AI to analyze user feedback after speed dating sessions.
- Identify trends in what users like or dislike.
